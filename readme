THINGS STILL NEED TO DO
1. Fix Terms and Conditions Pop Up
2. Make SUbmit form work on iphone
3. Fix up the approval page. Fix buttons. Make posts disappear after approval?
4. Make each Portwist clickable to a larger size w/ lightbox or something.
5. What happens when user submitted name is too long for one line?
6. Work Out Horizontal pics. Horizontal background. How does site determine?


Things I specifically need to do:
1. Cut off edge home button so it doesn't show on edge of page.
2. Start with (Your Name) and (YOur title) in boxes
3. Fix browse button: Make cursor to pointer. Make pic appear in background. SOmehow show user pic has been chosen.
4. Style the check box.
5. Fix up the copy on T and C next to style box (so terms and conditions links to pop up / url)
